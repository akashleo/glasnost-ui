### Monorepo Scripts

This project uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) to manage monorepo scripts. You can run scripts from the root `package.json` to target all packages at once.

-   `pnpm dev`: Start development servers for all packages and docs apps.
-   `pnpm build`: Build all packages and docs apps.
-   `pnpm test`: Run tests for all packages.
-   `pnpm lint`: Lint all packages.
-   `pnpm clean`: Clean all `dist` and `node_modules` folders.
-   `pnpm format`: Format the entire codebase with Prettier.

You can also run scripts for a specific package using the `--filter` flag:
```bash
# Build only the React package
pnpm --filter @glasnost-ui/react build
```

### Coding Style

-   **Code Formatting**: We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for automatic code formatting. Please run `pnpm format` before committing your changes.
-   **TypeScript**: All code should be written in TypeScript with strict type checking.

### Adding a New Component

To add a new component, follow these steps:

1.  Create the component file in the respective framework's `packages/[framework]/src/components` directory.
2.  Export the new component from `packages/[framework]/src/index.ts`.
3.  Add the component to the documentation app in `apps/[framework]-docs` to showcase its functionality.
4.  Ensure the component is themable, responsive, and accessible.
